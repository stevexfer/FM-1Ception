//==============================================================================
// The firmware library (MENU > Firmware Library): every .fwsc under a folder the
// user picks, found by a recursive scan, and what the user says of each (its
// category, rating, source URL, a name of their own) in one JSON file beside
// the per-firmware settings (FirmwarePrefs.h):
//
//   macOS    ~/Library/Application Support/Xfer Records/FM-1Ception/FirmwareLibrary.json
//   Windows  %APPDATA%\Xfer Records\FM-1Ception\FirmwareLibrary.json
//
// A scan only reads a file it has not seen at that size and date; what it
// reads (the name the firmware gives itself, a digest of its bytes) comes from
// fm1e_probe_package. A file moved or renamed within the folder keeps what was
// said of it, found again by its digest; one deleted takes it with it. A folder
// that is not there (a drive not mounted) forgets nothing.
//
// Message thread only (the scan has a thread of its own). Every plug-in
// instance in a process shares one, with its Cloud list: SharedFirmwareLibrary
// (CloudCatalog.h).
